--- PART I ---

You HAVE TO use regular expression package (use that command: import re)
You have given a file named "prom_seqs.txt" which contains the transcript names and the promoter sequences belong. 
Below, you have a list containing the motifs of DNA binding sites for several transcription factors. 

mtfs = {"BCL6": "[TA].CTTTC.AGG[AG]AT", "SP1": "[GT]GGGCGG[GA][GA][CT]", "AP1": "TGA[GC]TCA", "NF-I": "TTGGC.{5}GCCAA"}

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is finding the transcripts containing any of those motifs and generating a file 
for the output.

Your output file should be tab-separated lines with 1- Transcription factor Name (TF_name)
													2- TranscriptID 
													3- number of recognition sites
													4- sequence of the first recognition site
													5- start position of the first recognition site
													6- end position of the first recognition site

Please name your output file as Hw5_yourNameSurname_output.txt

Sample first two lines of your output file: 
TF_name	TranscriptID	#recog_sites	seq_recog_site	start	end
AP1    ENST00000374379    2    TGACTCA    2125    2132

Using the genelist and lengthlist below, create a dictionary with the following format:
genelist = ['GPR139 ', 'YAP1', 'RASGEF1B', 'PAH', 'PLCB2', 'GAPDH', 'SST']
lengthlist = [1613, 2393, 2277, 4122, 4616, 1875, 618]

mydict = {'GPR139' : 1613, 'YAP1' : 2393, 'RASGEF1B' : 2277, 'PAH' : 4122, 'PLCB2' : 4616, 'GAPDH' : 1875, 'SST' : 618}

Ask the user to give an integer. Loop through the dictionary and find the genes whose length is greater than the input.
Print their names and their total length on the screen.

Your script should loop until the user types exit as input.

Sample output:

Please give a number (type 'exit' to exit):4000

Genes whose length is greater than 4000 are:
PAH
PLCB2
Sum of their lengths:
8738

Please give a number (type 'exit' to exit):2300

Genes whose length is greater than 2300 are:
PAH
PLCB2
YAP1
Sum of their lengths:
11131

Please give a number (type 'exit' to exit):exit
